  "readme": "#webpack-dashboard\n\nA CLI dashboard for your webpack dev server\n\n### What's this all about?\n\nWhen using webpack, especially for a dev server, you are probably used to seeing something like this:\n\n![http://i.imgur.com/p1uAqkD.png](http://i.imgur.com/p1uAqkD.png)\n\nThat's cool, but it's mostly noise and scrolly and not super helpful. This plugin changes that. Now when you run your dev server, you basically work at NASA:\n\n![http://i.imgur.com/5BWa1hB.png](http://i.imgur.com/5BWa1hB.png)\n\n### Install\n\n`npm install webpack-dashboard --save-dev`\n\n### Use\n\n***OS X Terminal.app users:*** Make sure that **View â†’ Allow Mouse Reporting** is enabled, otherwise scrolling through logs and modules won't work. If your version of Terminal.app doesn't have this feature, you may want to check out an alternative such as [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/index.html).\n\nFirst, import the plugin and add it to your webpack config, or apply it to your compiler:\n\n```js\n// Import the plugin:\nvar DashboardPlugin = require('webpack-dashboard/plugin');\n\n// If you aren't using express, add it to your webpack configs plugins section:\nplugins: [\n    new DashboardPlugin()\n]\n\n// If you are using an express based dev server, add it with compiler.apply\ncompiler.apply(new DashboardPlugin());\n```\nIf using a custom port, the port number must be included in the options object here, as well as passed using the -p flag in the call to webpack-dashboard. See how below:\n\n```js\nplugins: [\n    new DashboardPlugin({ port: 3001 })\n]\n```\n\nIn the latest version, you can either run your app, and run `webpack-dashboard` independently (by installing with `npm install webpack-dashboard -g`) or run webpack-dashboard from your `package.json`. So if your dev server start script previously looked like:\n\n```js\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"node index.js\"\n}\n```\n\nYou would change that to:\n\n```js\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"webpack-dashboard -- node index.js\"\n}\n```\nNow you can just run your start script like normal, except now, you are awesome. Not that you weren't before. I'm just saying. More so.\n\n#### Run it\n\nFinally, start your server using whatever command you have set up. Either you have `npm run dev` or `npm start` pointed at `node devServer.js` or something along those lines.\n\nThen, sit back and pretend you're an astronaut.\n\n### API\n\n#### webpack-dashboard (CLI)\n##### Options\n\n - `-c, --color [color]` - Custom ANSI color for your dashboard\n - `-m, --minimal` - Runs the dashboard in minimal mode\n - `-t, --title [title]` - Set title of terminal window\n - `-p, --port [port]` - Custom port for socket communication\n\n##### Arguments\n\n`[command]` - The command you want to run, i.e. `webpack-dashboard -- node index.js`\n\n#### Webpack plugin\n#### Options\n\n - `port` - Custom port for socket communication\n - `handler` - Plugin handler method, i.e. `dashboard.setData`\n\n*Note: you can also just pass a function in as an argument, which then becomes the handler, i.e. `new DashboardPlugin(dashboard.setData)`*\n\n#### Credits\n\nModule output deeply inspired by: [https://github.com/robertknight/webpack-bundle-size-analyzer](https://github.com/robertknight/webpack-bundle-size-analyzer)\n\nError output deeply inspired by: [https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)\n",
